# shoot-the-moons
My CS 120 final project: a simple Python minigame, in which the user shoots at targets (moons) to score points, by controlling the cannonball's velocity and shooting angle.

In this game, to increase difficulty, the player can only score when the cannonball touches the moon from above. The game also keeps track of the user's score.
